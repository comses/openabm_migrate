#OpenABM Migrate module

This module is based on the Migrate ([Project Page](https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate)) and Drupal-to-Drupal Data Migration ([Project Page](https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_d2d)) frameworks.

Because some of the site migration process involves additional actions outside of the scope of this module, an additional readme file will be added that outlines the full migration procedure, including settings changes to be made on the destination Drupal instance, importing updated content type definitions, etc.
